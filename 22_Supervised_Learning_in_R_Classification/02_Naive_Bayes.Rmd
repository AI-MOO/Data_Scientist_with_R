# Section 02: **Naive Bayes**

### **`01-Computing probabilities`**

The `where9am` data frame contains 91 days (thirteen weeks) worth of data in which Brett recorded his `location` at 9am each day as well as whether the `daytype` was a weekend or weekday.

Using the conditional probability formula below, you can compute the probability that Brett is working in the office, given that it is a weekday.

P(A\|B)=P(A and B)P(B)

Calculations like these are the basis of the Naive Bayes destination prediction model you'll develop in later exercises.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
file_path <- file.path("..", "00_Datasets", "where9am.txt")
where9am <- read.delim(file_path)

locations_data_URL <- "https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/718/datasets/571628c39048df59c40c9dcfba146a2cf7a4a0e3/locations.csv"
locations <- read_csv(locations_data_URL)


head(where9am)
head(locations)
```

-   Find P(office) using `nrow()` and `subset()` to count rows in the dataset and save the result as `p_A`.

-   Find P(weekday), using `nrow()` and `subset()` again, and save the result as `p_B`.

-   Use `nrow()` and `subset()` a final time to find P(office and weekday). Save the result as `p_AB`.

-   Compute P(office \| weekday) and save the result as `p_A_given_B`.

-   Print the value of `p_A_given_B`.

```{r}
# Compute P(A) 
p_A <- nrow(subset(where9am, location == "office")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute P(B)
p_B <- nrow(subset(where9am, daytype == "weekday")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute the observed P(A and B)
p_AB <- nrow(subset(where9am, (location == "office") & (daytype == "weekday"))) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute P(A | B) and print its value
p_A_given_B <- p_AB / p_B
print(p_A_given_B)
```

### **`02-Understanding dependent events`**

In the previous exercise, you found that there is a 60% chance Brett is in the office at 9am given that it is a weekday. On the other hand, if Brett is never in the office on a weekend, which of the following is/are true?

-   P(office and weekend) = 0.

-   P(office \| weekend) = 0.

-   Brett's location is dependent on the day of the week.

-   All of the above. `(the answer)`

### 

### **`03-A simple Naive Bayes location model`**

The previous exercises showed that the probability that Brett is at work or at home at 9am is highly dependent on whether it is the weekend or a weekday.

To see this finding in action, use the `where9am` data frame to build a Naive Bayes model on the same data.

You can then use this model to predict the future: where does the model think that Brett will be at 9am on Thursday and at 9am on Saturday?

The data frame `where9am` is available in your workspace. This dataset contains information about Brett's location at 9am on different days.

```{r}
# Load the naivebayes package
library(naivebayes)

# Build the location prediction model
locmodel <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype, data = where9am)


thursday9am <- data.frame(daytype = "weekday")
saturday9am <- data.frame(daytype = "weekend")

# Predict Thursday's 9am location
predict(locmodel, thursday9am)

# Predict Saturdays's 9am location
predict(locmodel, saturday9am)
```

Awesome job! Not surprisingly, Brett is most likely at the office at 9am on a Thursday, but at home at the same time on a Saturday!

### **`04-Examining "raw" probabilities`**

The `naivebayes` package offers several ways to peek inside a Naive Bayes model.

Typing the name of the model object provides the *a priori* (overall) and conditional probabilities of each of the model's predictors. If one were so inclined, you might use these for calculating *posterior* (predicted) probabilities by hand.

Alternatively, R will compute the posterior probabilities for you if the `type = "prob"` parameter is supplied to the `predict()` function.

Using these methods, examine how the model's predicted 9am location probability varies from day-to-day. The model `locmodel` that you fit in the previous exercise is available for you to use, and the `naivebayes` package has been pre-loaded.

-   Print the `locmodel` object to the console to view the computed *a priori* and conditional probabilities.

-   Use the `predict()` function similarly to the previous exercise, but with `type = "prob"` to see the predicted probabilities for Thursday at 9am.

-   Compare these to the predicted probabilities for Saturday at 9am.

```{r}
# Examine the location prediction model
locmodel

# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Thursday at 9am
predict(locmodel, thursday9am, type = "prob")

# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Saturday at 9am
predict(locmodel, saturday9am, type = "prob")

```

### **`05-Understanding independence`**

Understanding the idea of event independence will become important as you learn more about how "naive" Bayes got its name. Which of the following is true about independent events?

**`Ans.`** Knowing the outcome of one event does not help predict the other.

Yes! One event is independent of another if knowing one doesn't give you information about how likely the other is. For example, knowing if it's raining in New York doesn't help you predict the weather in San Francisco. The weather events in the two cities are independent of each other.

### **`06-Who are you calling naive?`**

The Naive Bayes algorithm got its name because it makes a "naive" assumption about event independence.

What is the purpose of making this assumption?

**`Answer:`** The joint probability calculation is simpler for independent events.

Yes! The joint probability of independent events can be computed much more simply by multiplying their individual probabilities.

### 
**`07-A more sophisticated location model`**

The `locations` dataset records Brett's location every hour for 13 weeks. Each hour, the tracking information includes the `daytype` (weekend or weekday) as well as the `hourtype` (morning, afternoon, evening, or night).

Using this data, build a more sophisticated model to see how Brett's predicted location not only varies by the day of week but also by the time of day. The dataset `locations` is already loaded in your workspace.

You can specify additional independent variables in your formula using the `+` sign (e.g. `y ~ x + b`).

The `naivebayes` package has been pre-loaded.

-   Use the R formula interface to build a model where location depends on both `daytype` and `hourtype`. Recall that the function `naive_bayes()` takes 2 arguments: `formula` and `data`.

-   Predict Brett's location on a weekday afternoon using the data frame `weekday_afternoon` and the `predict()` function.

-   Do the same for a `weekday_evening`.

```{r}
file_path <- file.path("..", "00_Datasets", "locations_co22.txt")
locations <- read.delim(file_path)

weekday_afternoon <- data.frame(daytype = "weekday",
                                hourtype = "afternoon",
                                location = "office" )

weekday_evening <- data.frame(daytype = "weekday",
                                hourtype = "evening",
                                location = "home" )
```

```{r}
# Build a NB model of location
locmodel <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype  + hourtype, data = locations)

# Predict Brett's location on a weekday afternoon
predict(locmodel, weekday_afternoon)

# Predict Brett's location on a weekday evening
predict(locmodel, weekday_evening)


```

### **`08-Preparing for unforeseen circumstances`**

While Brett was tracking his location over 13 weeks, he never went into the office during the weekend. Consequently, the joint probability of P(office and weekend) = 0.

Explore how this impacts the predicted probability that Brett may go to work on the weekend in the future. Additionally, you can see how using the Laplace correction will allow a small chance for these types of unforeseen circumstances.

The model `locmodel` is available for you to use, along with the data frame `weekend_afternoon`. The `naivebayes` package has also been pre-loaded.

-   Use the `locmodel` to output predicted probabilities for a weekend afternoon by using the `predict()` function. Remember to set the `type` argument.

-   Create a new naive Bayes model with the Laplace smoothing parameter set to `1`. You can do this by setting the `laplace` argument in your call to `naive_bayes()`. Save this as `locmodel2`.

-   See how the new predicted probabilities compare by using the `predict()` function on your new model.

```{r}
weekend_afternoon <- locations[85,]

# Observe the predicted probabilities for a weekend afternoon
predict(locmodel, weekend_afternoon, type = "prob")

# Build a new model using the Laplace correction
locmodel2 <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype  + hourtype, data = locations, laplace = 1)

# Observe the new predicted probabilities for a weekend afternoon
predict(locmodel2, weekend_afternoon, type = "prob")

```

### **`09-Understanding the Laplace correction`**

By default, the `naive_bayes()` function in the `naivebayes` package does not use the Laplace correction. What is the risk of leaving this parameter unset?

-   Some potential outcomes may be predicted to be impossible. [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/)

-   The algorithm may have a divide by zero error.

-   Naive Bayes will ignore features with zero values.

-   The model may not estimate probabilities for some cases.

Correct! The small probability added to every outcome ensures that they are all possible even if never previously observed.

### **`10-Handling numeric predictors`**

Numeric data is often **binned** before it is used with Naive Bayes. Which of these is not an example of binning?

-   Age values recoded as 'child' or 'adult' categories

-   Geographic coordinates recoded into geographic regions (West, East, etc.)

-   Test scores divided into four groups by percentile

-   Income values standardized to follow a normal bell curve [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/)
